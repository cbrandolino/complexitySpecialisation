List as many ways of measuring or assessing complexity in the Anthropocene as you can remember. Consider the list you have produced. Free-write on the question: Is complexity fundamentally greater (quantitatively or qualitatively) in the Anthopocene compared to earlier human social complexity?

List as many real-world problems as you can that relate to increased complexity in the Anthropocene. Consider the list you have produced. Free-write on the question: How does an understanding of complexity in the Anthropocene help us to understand these problems?
