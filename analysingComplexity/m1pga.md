# Target organisation and mission statement

Finleap (https://www.finleap.com/) is an international FinTech company builder with headquarters in Berlin, Germany. It specialises in incubating fully digital ventures in the fields of banking, insurance, payment systems and asset management.

Finleap aims to foster a collaborative ecosystem for its 13+ ventures, providing entrepreneurial and financial expertise together with help in logistics and a common office space for the companies's first steps. It connects product and tech teams with specific industry experts, and aims to grow an incubator-wide talent pool able to contribute to multiple ventures.

# Context: shared challenges, individual responses

During my time as a consultant for one of the ventures in the incubator, the b2b2c wealth management platform elinvar (https://elinvar.de), our team faced several challenges related to User Experience and the choice of technology for user-facing products.

We established a set of practices and patterns to guide the development of our product. On the code level, we established a library of reusable components for several of the UX problems we faced.

While such patterns proved very useful, a significant start-up cost was associated with their creation and refinement.

# Problem definition

Many FinTech companies face some similar challenges. Interface components and software libraries are being created, and workshopping techniques are being established to face them.

A standardised set of solutions would significantly decrease the amount of decisions and testing each venture would face during its initial development phase.

To see whether such collaborative approach can be viable and to evaluate the different ways in which it could be enacted, several questions need to be answered:

How can we identify the components of our software and UX systems that could be reused across different ventures under the FinLeap umbrella?
How can we share the results of user research among ventures, maximising the amount of useful shared information while limiting the overhead for each single company?
How can we establish a common library for components of our user-facing codebase, keeping into account the single ventures' need for customisation?
How to incentivise sharing and collaboration for each of the ventures?
